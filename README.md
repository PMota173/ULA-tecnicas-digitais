# VHDL Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
This project implements an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in VHDL, developed as part of the Digital Techniques classes as an assignment.

### Description
The ALU is responsible for executing 10 different logical-arithmetic operations, operating with 3 inputs of 4 bits (A, B, and F) and producing a 14-bit output. The available operations include addition, subtraction, XNOR, shift right (A), shift left (B), A inverter, OR, XOR, AND, and NAND.

Additionally, the output is displayed on two 7-segment displays, and LED indicators are used to show if there was overflow, if the result is equal to zero, or if it is negative.
